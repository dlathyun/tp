### Project: SEPlendid

**SEPlendid** is a versatile application used by prospective exchangers to plan their Student Exchange Programme (SEP) 
study plans. Students from NUS Computing can use this CLI-based application, with a beautiful GUI, to view partner 
universities and course mappings. The application is also bundled with many other useful features.
